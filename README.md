# Cognexium
This is gonna be a web-app at first. Most likely built with the Laravel's PHP framework.
The idea is to build a personal knowledge base, gathering thoughts notes and projects, connecting nodes and helping people staying organized in their various thoughts ideas and project.

Then I realized that Obsidian existed, and does pretty much everything I wanted...
The only difference being, Obsidian is local and works with files on your device's HDD, while this project would be a web app hosted on a server.
